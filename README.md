# Cogswell College - Advanced C++ Course

In this course, I completed several high-level projects that the teacher and I designed to explore the infrastructure of Game Engines.
- Airplane Window
- Console Pacman
- Task Scheduler
- Tree Sets

Out of all the projects, I recommend my Console Pacman, in which I attempt to write an entire game engine that gets rendered by Windows command prompts.
